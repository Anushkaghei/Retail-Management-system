# Retail-Management-system
The "Online Shopping Application" is a comprehensive e-commerce platform created to address the changing needs of modern buyers and sellers. The project uses a client-server architecture. The idea stems from the growing demand for digital purchasing channels, which has been worsened by the cultural transformations caused by the COVID-19 epidemic.

A robust user login and authentication system, an extensive product catalogue with real-time data visualization, a user-friendly shopping cart, streamlined order processing, secure payment options, and exclusive admin management capabilities are among the key features. The project uses Python-Tkinter, MySQL, PyMySQL, and Canvas widgets to ensure data integrity, security, and real-time insights
